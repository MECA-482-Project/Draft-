The actively damped treadmill system consists of a treadmill and suspension system which reduces the peak reaction force felt by an object impacting the treadmill. The control is achieved by tuning the damping and spring coefficients in the suspension system, taking into account the spring and damping coefficients of the frame itself. The Project Teamâ€™s goal is to develop a comprehensive solution (explained in more details in the deliverables section) to reduce the impact for any weight within the limits.
